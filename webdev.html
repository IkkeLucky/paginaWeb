        <a href="#navtop"><h2>Why Webdev</h2></a>
        <p>It was around 2019 that I started getting closer to code and what it has to offer. It began with some of my friends telling me to create something. To take something from other interests of mine like tennis or economy and to make a webpage or to develop an app for my services</p>
        <p>I actually started discovering the incredible world of technology from building my own pc to creating functional websites. It was incredibly new for me and it was something that changes everyday. For me this is still a work in progress and I am still learning new things everyday.</p>
        <p>For me the final decision of choosing this to be my probably last career path is that this is really the future. Programming is changing and will change the world in the next following years, it will be the next future universal language.</p>

    <section id="certifications">
        <a href="#navtop"><h2>Certifications</h2></a>
        <p>Regarding certifications I have not yet received any since here in Argentina a career as Computer Science is not taught (or at least not the real one). So for the time being I am currently learning everything that I know via self taught programmes or courses and via freelancing.</p>
        <p>I started learning the basic components and functionality of a computer until I knew enough to build my own. After that I started learning some basic math and logic especially to tackle functions with loops, booleans, algorithms and more. I had already studied two years in Biomedical Engineering so getting that knowledge back was not that hard.
        <p>Finally after knowing the basics of math and hardware components I started coding and learning basic html and css until I could end up learning more about the specifics of html and css and nowadays I started also learning about Javascript. I still need to develop my backend with Javascript and maybe add another language such as Typescript or Rust to expand my knowledge into backend development. This is what I aim for in the future</p>

    <section id="experiences">
        <a href="#navtop"><h2>Experiences</h2></a>
        <p>Here I have a couple of freelancing experiences which I can tell you about. These are not the usual experiences that everyone would follow in courses such as creating web pages from the start or making calculators or ciphers or other kinds of mathematical projects or more solid projects.</p>
        <p>I started coding discord bots in Python with web APIs from Serum webpage (cryptocurrencies). I needed for a freelancing job to create simple discord bots that could fetch the price of different assets to be visualized in different servers, specially in one that I worked in the core team which was Apexit Finance</p>
        <p>With Apexit I coded discord bots as well, not just discord tickers, but security bots that had for example a list of forbidden words for profanity and spam. Also they denied users that spammed images or text with a determined number of words in full caps or emojis.</p>
        <p>After that I created a couple of simple websites with Wix and Wordpress for other friends and family that needed it for diverse projects such as a law consulting webpage, a veterinarian site that took appointments and an engineering blog for people to get to know this engineer's work.</p>
        <p>This is in full every project that I took part on (And this one here as well, you can follow me on my github since I will be posting repositories everyday with new code and my learning progress).</p>
